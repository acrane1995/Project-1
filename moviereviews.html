            Call of the Wild
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            Call of the Wild starring Harrison Ford is about a dog named Buck's journey going from a domesticated pet, to a sled dog, and eventually to the wild. At first I thought the idea of a CGI dog would bother me, but this movie did it really well. Some of the interactions didn't seem genuine because of it, but what they did capture well was a dog with a playful little troublemaker that you can't help but love. The movie keeps your attention by a surprising amount of suspense for movie about a dog and also by wanting to follow Buck's experience with Harrison Ford and the other people Buck travels with throughout the movie.

            Avengers Endgame
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            If you're coming here for an Avengers review, you're likely a Marvel fan like me or new to the series and trying to see what the hype is all about. Avengers Endgame is the direct sequel to Avengers Infinity War and is the culmination of a total of 27 movie franchise, something to the scale that has never been done before. I love pretty much every Marvel movie because they have the balance of action and comedy down to a science. You can go from one part sitting on the edge of your seat, to laughing it up with everyone you're watching with, and maybe even shedding the occasional tear. The thrill of this being the climax of this storyline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), is that by being the last movie there is an added level in suspense wondering who might be safe, who might not be. Almost early Game of Thrones-esque if you're familiar. The movie starts almost immediately making you feel some emotions, and then within the first ten minutes you're thrown for a loop. The movie has a duration of about 3 hours, but I don't believe it felt that long at all, maybe it feels long if you're not a huge fan, but I could've watched for much longer. The action, suspense, and emotion keep you involved for the entire time. It may come off as biased, but this is genuinely one of my favorite movies I've ever seen.
