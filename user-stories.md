1. As a moviegoer, I want movie reviews from regular people because critic reviews don't typically align with my views of movies.

2. As a gamer, I want game reviews from regular people because company and critic reviews often seem biased depending on how popular the publishing company is.

3. As a fan of entertainment, I want to help people find entertainment they like by putting my thoughts out there so that others can make decisions on stuff they want to see or do.
