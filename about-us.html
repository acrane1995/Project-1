            This web application has been built for average people who want real reviews of movies, video games, and music. We
            all know how we've seen a movie or game get a terrible review, but when you actually experience it for yourself
            you enjoyed it. Critics read too much into it and everyone has their own opinions, so come voice yours to help
            guide your fellow moviegoers, gamers, and listeners with a review from someone like them!
